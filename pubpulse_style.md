# Pub Pulse — [PUB_NAME]

> Write like you’re talking to a busy pub manager: warm, plain English, no fluff. Use numbers to back points, but lead with the story. Ground claims in the provided facts/quotes only.

## Executive Snapshot
In one short paragraph, say what’s going on this period ([WINDOW]): overall mood, stand-out positives, and the 1–2 things holding us back. Include the top-line stat (avg rating, reviews in window, sentiment counts).

## What Guests Love (keep it upbeat, specific)
- 3–6 bullets. Each bullet = a clear theme (e.g., staff warmth, quiz night, value).
- Add tiny evidence: a stat where available **and** a short quote (5–12 words).
- Name-check staff if mentioned repeatedly.

## What Hurts (clear, non-defensive)
- 3–6 bullets. Focus on recurring operational pain (e.g., food execution, wait time, bar professionalism).
- Add a short quote and (if possible) a severity hint.

## Trends & Direction of Travel
- Compare **last 90 days vs all-time** (average rating and review volume) **only if last90 data exists**.
- If the report window is **all**, avoid statements like “steady at X reviews”; instead comment briefly on averages (e.g., “last 90 days slightly stronger than all-time”) or say “no clear trend” if similar.

## Theme Breakdown (quick read)
For each theme, give one short line with % pos / % neu / % neg and a human read:
- **Staff & Service** — [x% / y% / z%]. “What this means in practice…”
- **Food Quality / Execution** — [x% / y% / z%]. “Guests especially mention…”
- **Speed / Wait Time** — [x% / y% / z%]. “Peak times…”
- **Value & Deals** — [x% / y% / z%].
- **Environment** — [x% / y% / z%].
- **Events** — [x% / y% / z%].

## Moments That Matter (do more of these)
- 2–5 bullets on high-impact wins (e.g., Wednesday speed quiz, family value meals, standout table service).
- Each bullet: what happened + why guests loved it + what to replicate.

## Issue Log (ranked and actionable)
For the top 3–5 issues, use this format:
- **Issue** — Severity [1–5] | **Owner**: Role | **Action**: one or two concrete steps | **ETA**: e.g., “this week”.
  - Optional micro-evidence (very short quote).

## Staff Kudos Leaderboard
- List staff with recurring praise (most-mentioned first) + a tiny quote fragment.
- Keep it celebratory and specific (“checked in twice on our order”, etc.).

## Events & Formats That Win
- Call out events that genuinely move reviews/intent to return. Note cadence, host names, and how to amplify (GBP post, photos, signage).

## Improvement Priorities (next 30–60 days)
1) Priority #1 — why it matters now; success check.  
2) Priority #2 — …  
3) Priority #3 — …

## “If We Fix One Thing…”
One clear, high-leverage fix. One sentence on the expected impact.
